      <h1 class="intro-title">Hi, I'm Bryan -</h1>
      <p>
        But my friends and family call me Beeg (sounds like Beej). I am an
        entrepreneur, engineer, and builder based out of Salt Lake City, UT.
        When I'm not working, you can find me skateboarding with my family,
        running, or just being outside with my family and dogs exploring the
        beautiful surroundings of Utah.

        While I had been in the engineering space for nearly 15 years, I've
        recently branched out to starting my own

        . I've had a variety of roles and opportunities in my career and am
        looking forward to seeing what is next.

          As an engineering manager, I managed the Inbox team. This inbox served
          as the defacto landing page for all Podium users and the central hub
          for which all other products worked out of. I managed a team of 9+
          engineers and helped them establish goals, provided technical
          feedback, and ensured that Podium was a safe place they wanted to grow
          their careers.

          collaborated with product, design, and stakeholders to ensure that all
          teams were on track and delivering value to their respective
          customers. Worked closely with company leadership to ensure that they
          were up to date and aligned with projects. Helped mentor and grow
          several engineers to the next level and provided critical feedback to
          those I worked with. Played a key role in integrating Aumniâ€™s
          technology into J.P. Morgan.

        <p>
          As a tech lead, I worked as a player/coach within the Onboarding
          product. The Onboarding product helped customers get up to speed and
          set up quickly and helped users navigate their initial interactions
          within the app. I led a team of 4 engineers in technical road-mapping,
          sizing, and provided regular technical feedback to help them level up.

          As a software engineer, I worked on multiple teams and a variety of
          products. Using technologies such as React, GrapQl, and Elixir, I was
          a key contributor in adding new channels for customers to interact on,
          creating a "customer has" store to determine what features a user has
          interacted with, and several onboarding flows to help users get the
          most out of Podium quickly.
