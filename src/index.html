      <h1 class="intro-title">Hi, I'm Bryan -</h1>
      <p>
        But my friends and family call me Beeg (sounds like Beej). I am an
        engineering manager residing in San Diego, CA. When I'm not working, you
        can find me skateboarding, surfing, running, or just being outside with
        my family and dogs exploring the beautiful surroundings of San Diego.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been working in the Web Development/Software Engineering space for
        about a decade and absolutley love it. I've worked in many roles
        including design, indivdiual contributor (back end and front end), and
        technical lead. I'm currently an engineering manager with a wide range
        of experience developing not only product but engineers as well.

        <div class="date">june 2019 - december 2022</div>
        <div class="position">engineering manager</div>
        <p>
          As an engineering manager, I managed the Inbox team. This inbox served
          as the defacto landing page for all Podium users and the central hub
          for which all other products worked out of. I managed a team of 9+
          engineers and helped them establish goals, provided technical
          feedback, and ensured that Podium was a safe place they wanted to grow
          their careers.
        </p>
        <div class="position">tech lead</div>
        <p>
          As a tech lead, I worked as a player/coach within the Onboarding
          product. The Onboarding product helped customers get up to speed and
          set up quickly and helped users navigate their initial interactions
          within the app. I led a team of 4 engineers in technical roadmapping,
          sizing, and provided regular technical feedback to help them level up.
        </p>
        <div class="position">software engineer</div>
        <p>
          As a software engineer, I worked on multiple teams and a variety of
          products. Using technologies such as React, GrapQl, and Elixir, I was
          a key contributor in adding new channels for customers to interact on,
          creating a "customer has" store to determine what features a user has
          interacted with, and several onboarding flows to help users get the
          most out of Podium quickly.

          As a Lead Instructor, responsibilities included teaching students,
          curating curriculum and managing 10-20 mentors and instructors.
          Developed several new course offerings including online, after hours,
          and Basecamp, all of which led to more students than ever having the
          opportunity to learn to code.
